For some strange reason you choose to keep going deeper into this terrible place!
As you head deeper and deeper you get closer to a turn in the cave that seems to be
emulating light from around it. You head around the corner and what is this you see..
it seems to be a huge room full of gold, coins, emeralds, and right in the middle of
the room there is a tall cliff face, it must be one hundred feet tall. The light is
coming off of the top of this cliff face.
