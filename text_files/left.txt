You head down the left path. You follow what seems to be a path that has
recently been taken. You see a strange figure laying on the ground.
As you approach you notice is seems to be a bag. You pick it up and inside you find
a letter. The letter says "To whom is unlucky enough to find this. You must play
the lottery to pass. just around the bend is the exit however, if you chose the lottery
numbers wrong you will most certainly parish. You must pick 5 numbers between 1 and 10,
and three of them must be correct to pass."
