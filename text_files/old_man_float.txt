His body suddenly stops in mid air. His glow turns from light blue to red. He turns and looks at
you with red beaming eyes. The old man screams "{self.name}, I have been watching you. I hoped
you would make the right decision and yet you throw an old frail man off a cliff for no reason.
You will suffer the consequences!"
As the old man hurls a fireball in your direction as you wonder if he would have been able to help you
escape.
