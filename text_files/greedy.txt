You begin to fill your pockets with treasures. Just then you hear the huge room
start to rumble. It begins to break apart. You begin to run to find a way out.
As you are darting and dodging falling boulders you come to the realization that
there is no door out of the place. You begin to run back the way you came and notice
the path is blocked. You run towards one of the edges of the room and duck for cover.
As the room fills with dirt and rock, you are never seen again.
